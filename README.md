# go is a pass-by-value language
# go makes copies of values when passed into functions - when we pass variables as arguments in function go makes a copy of those values for the function to use
# In go, variables can be split into two groups - 
# Group A (Non-Pointer values) - Strings, Ints, Floats, Booleans, Arrays, Structs
# Group B (Pointer wrapper values)- Slices, Maps, Functions
